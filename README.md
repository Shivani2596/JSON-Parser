# JSON-Parser

Create a component to render JSON data. The JSON schema can hold different types of data i.e Date, string, number, List.
Use the JSON to dynamically render each JSON field(key-value) on the screen.
For primitive types, render the data as a Label-Value pair.
For List type data, render a table with the key-names in the object as the column names.
Schema can have nested Tables as well. 
For that purpose, if a column is of type List, give the user the ability to view the nested table for that column (e.g: a ‘table’ icon on the column).
